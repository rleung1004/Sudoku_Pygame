# Sudoku_Pygame
Sudoku using pygame GUI

## Description
Sudoku is a very simple yet complicated game, and I have used the backtracking algorithm to create and solve Sudoku boards.
A sudoku object can be made by instatiating a Sudoku object, and its methods are to generate a puzzle, print the current state of the puzzle, and solve the puzzle.
There is a GUI component to it if you would like to interact with the sudoku puzzle using a GUI.

## Installation
To run this program, you need to install Python 3.
Please visit https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/ to install the latest version.

You will also need to install pygame from your terminal:
