# Sudoku_Pygame
Sudoku using pygame GUI

## Description
Sudoku is a very simple yet complicated game, and I have used the backtracking algorithm to create and solve Sudoku boards.
A sudoku object can be made by instatiating a Sudoku object, and its methods are to generate a puzzle, print the current state of the puzzle, and solve the puzzle.

## Installation
To run this program, you need to install Python 3.

Please visit https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/ to install the latest version.

You will also need to install pygame.

Run the command in your terminal:
`$ pip install pygame`

Run GUI.py to play the Sudoku puzzle with pygame window.
